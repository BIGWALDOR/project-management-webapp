# project-management-webapp
A very simple project management, full-stack web application built with React, ApolloClient, GraphQL, Express and MongoDB. I will look to add more functionality and features over time and look to integrate other frameworks/libraries into the application.  

Deployed the application on Heroku. Feel free to check it out and shout out any feedback you may have.

Next steps:
- Integrate NextJS or Remix into the application
- Rebuild application using TypeScript
- Conduct unit tests using Jest/React-Testing-Library
